# task_manager

Welcome to the Task Manager Application repository! This project showcases the culmination of my journey as a mobile application developer, where I've leveraged my expertise in API development, UI design, and state management to create a robust and intuitive task management solution.

## Overview

In this project, I've implemented task manager UI and integrated APIs that handle various CRUD operations, including getting, creating, updating, and deleting tasks. These APIs serve as the backbone of the application, providing seamless integration between the backend and frontend.

## Technologies Used

__API Development:__ Utilized my knowledge of API development to create a set of RESTful APIs using PHP and MySQL for the database.

__UI Design:__ Found inspiration for the task manager app design on the internet and implemented it using Flutter, a versatile and powerful framework.

__State Management:__ Integrated the APIs with the UI using Riverpod state management, ensuring efficient data flow and real-time updates.

## Features

__CRUD Operations:__ Users can perform CRUD operations on tasks, including creating, fetching, updating, and deleting tasks.

__Sleek UI:__ The application features a modern and intuitive user interface designed with Flutter, offering a seamless user experience.

__Real-time Updates:__ Leveraging Riverpod state management, the application provides real-time updates, ensuring data consistency across the platform.
